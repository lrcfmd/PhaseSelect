Lookup tables for properties defined by a pair of elements. The property is assumed to be independent of the order of the elements (e.g., AB must equal BA).

Each of these files have three columns: <A element>, <B element>, and <value>

B2BondLength.table

B2Volume.table
	Volume of a B2 unit cell composed of a certain pair of elements
	Units: Angstrom^3/atom
